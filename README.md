## Overview

RedCell is an end-to-end red team operations lab environment that showcases the complete attack lifecycle from reconnaissance to data exfiltration. This project demonstrates:

- Full attack chain methodology (aligned with MITRE ATT&CK)
- Custom command & control (C2) infrastructure
- Advanced persistence and evasion techniques
- Network pivoting and lateral movement
- Professional red team documentation and reporting

**Purpose:** Educational portfolio project for demonstrating advanced cybersecurity skills to potential employers.

## Features

### Command & Control
- Custom C2 server with encrypted communications (AES)
- Multiple communication protocols (HTTP/HTTPS, DNS tunneling)
- Beacon implants with jitter and randomization
- Operator CLI interface

### Attack Capabilities
- Automated reconnaissance and enumeration
- Multiple initial access vectors (SQLi, file upload, command injection)
- Privilege escalation exploits
- 5+ persistence mechanisms
- Network pivoting through compromised hosts
- Covert data exfiltration channels

### Defensive Evasion
- Payload obfuscation
- Anti-forensics techniques
- Log tampering and timestomping
- Traffic obfuscation

### Testing & Quality
- Comprehensive test suite (pytest)
- 70%+ code coverage
- Integration tests for full attack chain
- Defensive validation (blue team perspective)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python 3.9+
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd cyber

# Create Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start target infrastructure
docker-compose up -d

# Run tests
pytest
```

### Usage

```bash
# Start the C2 server
python c2/server/main.py

# In another terminal, start the operator interface
python c2/operator/cli.py

# Deploy an implant to a target (example)
python initial_access/sqli_exploit.py --target http://target-ip
```

## Ethical & Legal Notice

**IMPORTANT:** This project is designed exclusively for:
- Authorized security testing
- Educational purposes
- Portfolio demonstration
- Isolated lab environments

**Never use these tools on:**
- Systems you don't own
- Systems without explicit written authorization
- Production environments without proper authorization

All testing must be conducted in isolated, controlled lab environments. Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal.

## Testing Strategy

This project includes comprehensive testing:

- **Unit Tests:** Individual tool and function testing
- **Integration Tests:** End-to-end attack chain validation
- **Manual Testing:** Operational security testing
- **Defensive Validation:** Blue team perspective analysis

Run tests with: `pytest -v --cov`

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.9+** - Core language for tooling
- **Flask** - C2 server framework
- **Docker/Docker Compose** - Target environment isolation
- **pytest** - Testing framework
- **cryptography** - Encryption for C2 communications
- **requests** - HTTP client for exploits
