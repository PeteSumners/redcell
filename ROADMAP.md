**Best Practices:**
- Keep all work in isolated lab environment
- Don't expose C2 infrastructure to public internet unnecessarily
- Include prominent disclaimer in documentation
- Be prepared to explain ethical boundaries in interviews

## Next Steps

Once roadmap is approved:

1. **Run `/start`** to begin autonomous execution
2. Start with Phase 1 foundation work
3. Regular commits with clear documentation
4. Checkpoint reviews at end of each phase
