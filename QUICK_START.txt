CLAUDE CODE AUTONOMOUS PROJECT WORKFLOW - QUICK START GUIDE
===============================================================================

WHAT IS THIS?
-------------
This folder is set up so Claude Code can work autonomously on your project
without asking for permission. It will follow a roadmap, test as it goes,
and only mark tasks complete when they actually work.


HOW TO START A NEW PROJECT
---------------------------

1. Open Claude Code in this folder:

   cd C:\Users\PeteS\Desktop\ai_job
   claude


2. Run the init command:

   /init


3. Answer Claude's questions about your project:
   - What are you building?
   - What tech stack?
   - What features?
   - How to test it?


4. Claude will create a detailed ROADMAP.md and initial project structure


5. When you're ready, run:

   /start


6. Claude will work through the roadmap autonomously until done!


WHAT HAPPENS DURING /start?
----------------------------
- Reads ROADMAP.md
- Creates a todo list from it
- Works through each task one by one
- Runs tests after changes
- Only marks tasks complete when tests pass
- Reports to you when done (or if blocked)


IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A PLAN
---------------------------
Skip /init and just edit ROADMAP.md directly with your plan, then run /start


IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------
- Claude has full permissions in THIS FOLDER ONLY
- It will test constantly to make sure things work
- It won't mark tasks done if tests are failing
- If it gets stuck, it will ask you for help


FILES IN THIS SETUP
-------------------
.claude/settings.json       - Enables autonomous mode
.claude/commands/init.md    - Interactive project setup
.claude/commands/start.md   - Autonomous execution engine
ROADMAP.md                  - Your project plan (edit or use /init)


THAT'S IT!
----------
Just run /init to get started, then /start to let Claude build it.
